Plugins dequeue committed events, transform the payload slices they care about, and push them to external systems. Start here to pick a transport, then follow the linked sections for configuration and operational details.

## Overview

- Learn how selectors, batching, retries, and acknowledgements work together.
- Decide whether to run plugins alongside the daemon or remotely with MPC coordination.
- Track metrics and logs for each plugin so you can remediate failures quickly.

## HTTP

- POST payload slices to any HTTPS endpoint with configurable headers and auth.
- Use batching plus exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming downstream services.
- Export metrics such as delivery latency and DLQ counts.

## TCP

- Stream events over raw sockets when latency matters most.
- Wrap the channel in TLS, WireGuard, or SSH tunnels if the network is untrusted.
- Tune buffer sizes, batch counts, and concurrency to match consumer throughput.

## CaPnP

- Serialize payloads with Cap'n Proto for compact delivery and fast decoding.
- Generate schemas from EventDBX columns, then share them with downstream consumers.
- Plan for schema evolution by versioning messages and keeping decoders backwards compatible.

## Process

- Spawn local executables per event for ultimate flexibility (and responsibility).
- Template payloads into env vars or temporary files, then enforce CPU/memory limits.
- Monitor exit codes and timeouts to keep the queue healthy.

## Log

- Emit NDJSON to local or remote log collectors for SIEM/Audit ingestion.
- Rotate, compress, and ship logs with your preferred agent (Fluent Bit, Vector, etc.).
- Prefer the log plugin when you need human-readable trails or offline archives.
