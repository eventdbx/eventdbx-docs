---

The log plugin writes plugin envelopes (event/state/schema) to the EventDBX log output. It’s useful for quick debugging or lightweight audit trails without configuring external transports. Configuration is stored at the system data root (for example `~/.eventdbx/plugins.json`), and publish targets can be specified per write if you only want selected events to reach the log sink.

## Configuration

Configure via CLI (definitions are stored in `~/.eventdbx/plugins.json`; no TOML editing needed):

```bash
dbx plugin config log --name audit-log --level info --template "agg={aggregate} id={id} event={event}" --payload event-only
```

`template` controls event formatting; `{aggregate}`, `{id}`, and `{event}` placeholders are replaced. If state or schema are included via payload mode, they are logged as JSON.

## When to use

- Local debugging without extra infrastructure.
- Lightweight audit trails where log collectors (Splunk/Datadog/etc.) already ingest application logs.

Logs emit on the `eventdbx.plugin.log` target; forward them with your existing log pipeline. For stronger delivery guarantees, pair with HTTP/TCP/Capnp/process plugins.
