description: "Run managed binaries that consume EventDBX plugin envelopes."
---

The process plugin supervises a long-running binary and feeds it plugin envelopes from the queue. EventDBX handles installs, starts/stops, and retries; your worker handles the business logic. Configuration is stored at the system data root (for example `~/.eventdbx/plugins.json`).

## Configuration

```bash
dbx plugin config process --name search --plugin dbx_search --version 1.0.0 --arg "--port=9100" --env SEARCH_URL=http://search:9200 --payload event-only
dbx plugin start search --foreground   # or daemonise without --foreground
dbx plugin status search
dbx plugin stop search
```

## Runtime behaviour

- EventDBX supervises the worker; crashes trigger restarts.
- Plugin envelopes (event/state/schema per payload mode) are delivered over the managed channel defined by the process plugin SDK.
- Status files live under the domain data dir; `dbx plugin status` prints runtime state.

## Tips

- Keep handlers idempotent; retries occur when workers fail or return errors.
- Choose minimal payload modes (`event-only`, `extensions-only`) when possible to reduce queue pressure.
- Log errors to stderr so EventDBX surfaces them in plugin logs; use `dbx plugin test <name>` to send a sample envelope during development.
