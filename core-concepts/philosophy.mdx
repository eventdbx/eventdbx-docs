EventDBX centers on append-only truth, reproducible state, and integrations that never block writes. Use this page as the high-level compass, then jump into the linked deep dives when you are ready to ship.

## Flexibility

- Use `dbx checkout` to spin up isolated domains so experiments never bleed into production lanes.
- Reshape aggregates safely by re-snapshotting and replaying events instead of rewriting state in place.
- Feed only the slices each read model needs by tailoring plugin payload selectors.

## Data integrity

- Per-aggregate Merkle trees prove state, payload, and metadata authenticity.
- Toggle `dbx restrict` between permissive and strict modes to match your environment.
- Replication compares hashes before promoting a standby so you never ship drift.

## Security

- Mint Ed25519 tokens per role, rotate them regularly, and scope CLI commands tightly.
- Terminate TLS (or mTLS) at the daemon and plugins so credentials never cross plaintext.
- Treat plugin credentials as first-class secrets with rotation and audit hooks.

## Auditability

- Every aggregate keeps an append-only history plus deterministic snapshots for quick reads.
- Export proofs to auditors or partner teams without replaying production traffic.
- Use CLI helpers to sign, archive, and verify aggregate timelines.

## Extensibility

- Build plugins that emit just the payload slices downstream systems expect.
- Extend schema rules, column types, or transports without stopping the daemon.
- Bridge EventDBX into existing buses, CDC pipelines, or serverless workers.
