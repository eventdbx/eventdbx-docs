EventDBX is fundamentally built around these ideas: append-only truth, reproducible state, and integrations that are specifically designed to never block writes. This page serves as your high-level compass and philosophical guide to understanding the system's design principles, and when you feel ready to begin shipping and implementing solutions, you can jump into the linked deep dives that provide comprehensive technical details.

## Flexibility

- Start in `default` mode so teams can append JSON payloads without schema friction, then switch to `strict` once data shapes stabilize.
- Use `dbx checkout` to spin up isolated domains for experiments, bounded contexts (CQRS-style), or separate environments so changes never touch production or other domains.
- Feed each read model only the slices it needs by tailoring plugin payload selectors.

## Data integrity

- Per-aggregate Merkle trees serve as cryptographic proofs for state, payload, and metadata.
- Schemas use verbose column definitions with built-in types, formats, and validation rules (required, length, range, regex) so intent stays explicit and unambiguous.
- Toggle `dbx restrict` between permissive and strict modes to match your environment without rewriting history.

## Security

- Encrypt payloads, snapshots, and tokens at rest with the DEK, and enforce Noise handshakes in transit so credentials never cross plaintext.
- Append-only storage plus Merkle roots make the log immutable and tamper-evident.
- Generate Ed25519 tokens per role with fine-grained scopes (TTL, write limits), rotate them regularly, and keep authentication passwordless by design.

## Auditability

- Every aggregate keeps an append-only history plus deterministic snapshots for quick reads.
- Export proofs to auditors or partner teams without replaying production traffic.
- Stream or replay events to backtrack and retrace every change, then use CLI helpers to sign, archive, and verify aggregate timelines.

## Extensibility

- Build plugins that emit just the payload slices downstream systems expect.
- Extend schema rules, column types, or transports without stopping the daemon.
- Bridge EventDBX into existing buses, CDC pipelines, or serverless workers.
