title: "Aggregate & Event Model"
description: "Model aggregates, snapshots, and events so write-side history stays deterministic and verifiable."
---

Every state change flows through three artifacts: events, the aggregates they append to, and snapshots that keep reads fast. Calibrate each piece deliberately so you can replay history, prove integrity, and power downstream projections.

## Snapshots

- Materialize deterministic snapshots to serve reads quickly without replaying full histories.
- Schedule rebuilds or let EventDBX auto-refresh them once threshold counts are reached.
- Tune retention, compression, and pruning strategies to balance cost versus recovery speed.

## Aggregates

- Keep identifiers stable, scoped, and easy to shard across teams.
- Use metadata to track lifecycle decisions, ownership, and reconciliation markers.
- Avoid coupling unrelated concerns into a single aggregate—fan out instead.

## Events

- Version payload schemas carefully so older events remain readable.
- Lean on metadata for traceability, idempotency, and auditing hooks.
- Rebuild downstream read models by replaying events whenever integrations drift.
