EventDBX replication favors a primary-plus-standby topology: one node owns writes, while others stay warm and ready to take over. Operators use `push`, `pull`, and `watch` commands to keep Merkle trees aligned across environments.

## Approach a standby & non-distributive database

- Stick to a single writer to avoid conflicting histories; treat every other node as a deterministic replica.
- Promote a standby only after comparing Merkle hashes and verifying the last replicated offset.
- Capture automation runbooks for token rotation, firewall changes, and client failover when promotion happens.

## Watch / push / pull

- Use `dbx watch` to stream changes continuously when latency matters.
- Schedule `dbx push`/`dbx pull` windows for bulk transfers or air-gapped environments.
- Instrument retries, bandwidth, and drift alerts so operators catch failures quickly.
