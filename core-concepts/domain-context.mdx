Domains keep schemas, aggregates, and replication schedules scoped to a single bounded context. Operators can hop between them instantly, but each remains isolated on disk so experiments never corrupt production roots.

## Ability to switch between contexts

- Use `dbx checkout <domain>` to move between contexts while keeping local state, tokens, and logs separate.
- Pair `dbx status` with naming conventions (e.g., `payments-prod`, `payments-dev`) so operators always know which root they are touching.
- Promote or replicate contexts independently; watchers respect the active domain so migrations stay deterministic.
