Schema enforcement in EventDBX is opt-in and gradual: you start flexible, codify columns as you learn, then bake validation rules once the model hardens. Use this page as the entry point for schema planning.

## Column definition

- Choose column types (string, number, enum, JSON) that match how downstream systems consume data.
- Use `dbx schema column add` to evolve structures without rewriting historical payloads.
- Embed docs and ownership notes next to each column so teams know when it is safe to reuse them.

## Rules

- Attach validation rules globally or per column to enforce ranges, regexes, or custom predicates.
- Test new rules in permissive mode before promoting them to strict enforcement.
- Track how rule changes impact historical data and plan remediation steps up front.

## Format

- Pick JSON when you need inspection simplicity; switch to Cap'n Proto or other binaries for throughput.
- Document schema serialization choices so downstream teams can regenerate bindings.
- Plan migrations carefully: run dual writes, validate consumers, then deprecate the old format.
