Snapshots give you point-in-time state without replaying every event. EventDBX stores them alongside the event log and refreshes them automatically when needed.

## When snapshots refresh

- After a configurable number of events (`snapshot_threshold`).
- When an operator calls `dbx aggregate snapshot <aggregate> <id>`.
- When a plugin requests a payload slice that requires the latest state.

```bash
dbx aggregate snapshot invoice inv-9931
dbx aggregate snapshot show invoice inv-9931 --format json
```

Snapshots include payload, metadata, Merkle root, and the index of the last applied event.

## Storage layout

Snapshots live in the same RocksDB column family as aggregates. Each entry stores:

```
{
  "aggregate": "invoice",
  "id": "inv-9931",
  "version": 64,
  "payload": {...},
  "merkle_root": "a7f4...",
  "updated_at": "2024-05-04T11:12:33Z"
}
```

Compression keeps them small, so retaining several generations is cheap. Use `dbx snapshot prune` to drop old versions if you need to reclaim disk.

## Tuning cadence

- **High-churn aggregates** (carts, sessions): lower `snapshot_threshold` to 5–10 events so plugins read fresh state quickly.
- **Low-churn aggregates** (accounts, ledgers): keep the threshold high (100+) to minimize writes.
- **Large payloads**: consider enabling incremental snapshots so only changed fields are persisted.

Configure per aggregate type:

```toml
[aggregate.invoice]
snapshot_threshold = 25
[aggregate.cart]
snapshot_threshold = 8
```

Set a global default via `dbx config --snapshot-threshold <count>` and override per aggregate with `dbx schema create ... --snapshot-threshold <count>` or `dbx schema update ...`.

## Using snapshots downstream

Plugins can request snapshots instead of replaying events:

```toml
selector = { include_snapshot = true, include_events = false }
```

Use this for read models that want current state (search indexes, caches) without caring about the entire history. If a downstream system falls behind, simply replay snapshots plus events from the last acknowledged offset.
