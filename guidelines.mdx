title: "Guidelines"
description: "Shared engineering, documentation, and community practices for the EventDBX project."
---

These guidelines keep EventDBX cohesive across code, docs, and community touchpoints. Pair them with the [Contributing guide](/contributing) for step-by-step workflows.

## Core principles

- **Security by default** – assume every change touches sensitive data; never ship secrets, always validate payloads, and keep dependency audits flowing.
- **Deterministic builds** – document exact toolchain versions in `README.md` or per-component guides so other contributors reproduce results without guesswork.
- **Traceable decisions** – capture architecture or product decisions in RFCs, issues, or discussions and link them from the relevant docs page.

## Engineering practices

1. Start from a fresh branch named `feature/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`.
2. Keep commits reviewable and describe intent, not implementation details.
3. Add or update automated tests whenever behavior, schemas, or CLI surfaces change.
4. Run the linters/formatters (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`, `cargo fmt`, etc.) before opening a pull request.

Use feature flags rather than long-lived branches for experimental functionality, and prefer backwards-compatible migrations so downstream plugins stay stable.

## Documentation standards

- Every new feature, command, or configuration surface needs at least a short note in the docs.
- Frontmatter (`title`, `description`) should be specific enough to appear alone in search results.
- Add `Tip`, `Warning`, or tables when they help the reader act faster; avoid duplicating long CLI outputs unless they illustrate a concept.
- Link to related sections (for example, `/core-concepts/schema-definition`) so readers can build context progressively.

## Issue and PR hygiene

- Open issues with reproduction steps, environment details, and the observed vs. expected behavior.
- Reference issues from pull requests using `Fixes #123` (or `Relates to #123` for partial work) so automation can trace deployments.
- Surface breaking changes in both the PR description and `CHANGELOG.md` under the “Unreleased” heading.

## Community expectations

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Interactions in issues, discussions, and Slack should stay respectful, inclusive, and focused on the work. Use private channels or the security mailing list when disclosure requires it.
